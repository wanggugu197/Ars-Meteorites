## Introduction

Introduction
Ars Meteorites is a meteorite mod. When you are tired of the blood magic meteorite ritual, you can check out this meteorite add-on mod based on Ars Nouveau.
You can add different catalysts to summon different meteorites.
Each meteorite will consume a large amount of Source and generate a large amount of resources.
Some meteorites that are compatible with the original version have been added. And some meteorites that are linked with other modules.
I will also try to link with more modules to enrich the game experience.
If you want to add meteorites from certain modules, you can also propose it.
